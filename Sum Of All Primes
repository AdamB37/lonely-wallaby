Sum all the prime numbers up to and including the provided number.

A prime number is defined as a number greater than one and having only two divisors, one and itself. 
For example, 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by one and two.

The provided number may not be a prime.

function sumPrimes(num) {
 var range = [], i, j, sum, primes = []; 
 for (i = 2; i <= num; ++i) {
 if (!range[i]) {
  // i has not been marked -- it is prime
  primes.push(i);
   for (j = i < 1; j <= num; j += i) {
   range[j] = true;
     }  
   sum = primes.reduce(add, 0);
  function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
    }
  }
 }
  return sum;
 }
sumPrimes(10);
